# Understanding the Quantum State |ψ⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2

> Based on material from [quantum.country](https://quantum.country)

This document explains the state, its vector form, measurement behavior, and Bloch-sphere interpretation.

## 1. Writing the State in Vector Form

The computational basis states are:

```
|0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ
|1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ
```

So the given state becomes:

```
|ψ⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, i]ᵀ
```

This is the **component (column vector) notation** for the state.

## 2. Intuitive Meaning

The factor `i` (representing a 90° phase shift) means that the two parts of the superposition — |0⟩ and |1⟩ — are **out of phase**.

On the **Bloch sphere**:
- `|0⟩` is at the north pole.
- `|1⟩` is at the south pole.
- `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2` lies on the **+X axis**.
- Our state `( |0⟩ + i|1⟩ ) / √2` lies on the **+Y axis**.

So this state is rotated by **90° about the Z-axis** compared to `|+⟩`.

We usually call this state:

```
|y+⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) / √2
```

## 3. Measurement Outcomes

### In the Z-basis (|0⟩, |1⟩)

```
p(0) = |⟨0|ψ⟩|² = 1/2
p(1) = |⟨1|ψ⟩|² = 1/2
```

So measuring in the computational (Z) basis gives equal probabilities for `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`.

---

### In the Y-basis (|y+⟩, |y−⟩)

Define:

```
|y+⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2
|y−⟩ = (|0⟩ − i|1⟩)/√2
```

Since `|ψ⟩ = |y+⟩`, measurement results are deterministic:

```
p(y+) = 1
p(y−) = 0
```

So the qubit is **fully aligned with the +Y direction**.

---

## 4. Density Matrix Form

The density matrix ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| is:

```
ρ = (1/2) * [[1, -i],
              [i,  1]]
```

---

## 5. Pauli Operator Expectations

Using the Pauli matrices:

```
σx = [[0, 1],
      [1, 0]]

σy = [[0, -i],
      [i,  0]]

σz = [[1,  0],
      [0, -1]]
```

The expectation values are:

```
⟨σx⟩ = 0
⟨σy⟩ = +1
⟨σz⟩ = 0
```

So the Bloch vector for this state is:

```
r = (0, 1, 0)
```

which confirms it lies on the **+Y axis**.

---

## 6. Projector Representation

Projectors for Y-basis measurement:

```
Π(y+) = (1/2) * [[1, -i],
                 [i,  1]]

Π(y−) = (1/2) * [[1,  i],
                 [-i, 1]]
```

These satisfy:
```
Π(y+) + Π(y−) = I
Π(y+) − Π(y−) = σy
```

---

## 7. Circuit That Prepares This State

Start from `|0⟩` and apply:

1. **Hadamard (H)** gate:
   ```
   H|0⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2 = |+⟩
   ```

2. **Phase (S)** gate:
   ```
   S = diag(1, i)
   S|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2 = |ψ⟩
   ```

Circuit notation:

```
|0⟩ ── H ── S ──▶ |ψ⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2
```

## 8. Summary Table

| Property | Symbol / Formula | Result |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **State** | `|ψ⟩` | `( |0⟩ + i|1⟩ ) / √2` |
| **Vector form** | — | (1/√2) · [1, i]ᵀ |
| **Bloch vector** | — | (0, 1, 0) |
| **Axis on Bloch sphere** | — | +Y |
| **Z-basis measurement** | — | (½, ½) |
| **Y-basis measurement** | — | (1, 0) |
| **⟨σx⟩, ⟨σy⟩, ⟨σz⟩** | — | (0, 1, 0) |
| **Preparation circuit** | — | H → S |

---

## 9. Interpretation

This qubit state represents a **pure phase rotation** of `|+⟩`.  
It behaves identically to `|+⟩` when measured in Z or X bases,  
but yields a deterministic outcome when measured along the Y axis.  

This shows how a **relative phase** — even if invisible in one basis —  
corresponds to a **rotation on the Bloch sphere**, which *does* affect other measurements.
